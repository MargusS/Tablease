# Tablease - Microservices-Based Restaurant Management System

**Tablease** is a distributed system designed to manage restaurant operations.  
It is structured as a **monorepo of independent microservices**, each built with **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and following **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

## About the project

Tablease covers multiple workflows found in modern restaurants, such as:

- Order management (creation, tracking, splitting between kitchen and bar)
- Inventory management
- Kitchen and bar operations
- Menu and dishes management
- Notification delivery to staff and customers

Each functionality is encapsulated in a specific microservice, ensuring a modular and scalable design.

## Services

| Service              | Description                        | Status               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **order-service**     | Handles general order management   | ðŸŸ¡ Base structure     |
| **kitchen-service**   | Manages kitchen orders             | ðŸŸ¡ Base structure     |
| **bar-service**       | Manages bar orders                 | ðŸŸ¡ Base structure     |
| **inventory-service** | Manages stock and inventory        | ðŸŸ¡ Base structure     |
| **menu-service**      | Manages dishes and menus           | ðŸ”§ **In active development** |
| **notification-service** | Sends notifications to staff/customers | ðŸŸ¡ Base structure |

---

## Deployment

The infrastructure is managed using **Docker Compose**.

```bash
cd infra
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

- Dedicated PostgreSQL databases for each microservice
- Kafka and Zookeeper (for event-driven communication, in progress)
- Database initialization scripts

### Database initialization

All databases are initialized through SQL scripts located in `infra/init/`.

Example:

```
infra/init/menu/initDB.sql   # Creates and seeds the menu database
```

---

## Development and automation

The project includes automation tools to speed up development.

### Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided at the root of the project to simplify operations:

```bash
make help      # Shows available commands
```

The help command will guide you through actions such as building services, starting databases, running services locally, or creating new bounded contexts.

### Framework utilities

Within the `framework/` folder, you'll find additional scripts like:

```bash
framework/create-bc.sh   # Automates the creation of new bounded contexts
```
